            <p>
                Cash, in layman's term, contains bills and coins. In business and economic sense, it
                also includes checks, cash in banks, and money orders. This also serves as the
                medium of exchange, and it is considered to be the most liquid asset as it can be
                used in the greatest number of transactions.
            </p>
            <p>
                Cash is what an entity is after and is the final result of an entity's operations. Entities
                spend money for machineries and equipment to turn raw materials to inventory,
                sell the inventory as receivables, and finally collect the receivables as cash. It can
                also be said that "<strong>cash is king</strong>".
            </p>
            <p>
                The prospect of receiving more cash is also a driving force for investors to invest
                their money in a profit motivated entity in the form of investments in stocks or
                loans. This additional cash comes from dividends, interests, other distributions, and
                the proceeds from the ultimate disposal of these investments.
            </p>
            
            <h2 id="identifyingItemsOfCash">Identifying Items of Cash</h2>
            <p>Determining which items can be classified as cash can be a bit tricky since there are
                no explicit guidelines in the accounting standards. Usually, those items which have
                the following characteristics are considered as part of cash:
                a. Can be spent for a wide range of objectives; and
                b. Substantially unrestricted as to the usage.
            </p>
            <p>
                For accounting purposes, "cash" can be classified into the following three
                categories, including some examples under each category:
